# Korean Legal QA Service

This project demonstrates a prototype service for answering Korean legal questions using a language model.

## Dataset

A small example dataset (`data/legal_cases.jsonl`) contains mock Korean case law snippets with citations.

## Training

`scripts/train.py` shows how to fine‑tune a Korean GPT-2 model (e.g., `skt/kogpt2-base-v2`) on the dataset using Hugging Face Transformers.
Run:

```bash
python scripts/train.py --model skt/kogpt2-base-v2 --dataset data/legal_cases.jsonl --output_dir model
```

## API

`api/main.py` defines a FastAPI application exposing a `/ask` endpoint. It retrieves simple matches from the dataset and generates an answer using the model.

Run the API:

```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --reload
```

## Assumptions and Limitations

- The provided dataset is minimal and for demonstration only.
- Retrieval is a naive keyword search, not production quality.
- The model is fine‑tuned on limited data and may produce incorrect or nonsensical answers.
- This service **does not** constitute official legal advice.

## Disclaimer

Responses are generated by an AI model. They may be inaccurate or incomplete. Consult a qualified attorney for professional legal guidance.
